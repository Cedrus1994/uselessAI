# 🎥 Video Monitoring AI Agent with ChatGPT 4.0 Integration

## 📄 Description

Developed an AI agent for monitoring video feeds, generating natural language descriptions using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API. The application is built with React and hosted on GitHub Pages. Later, I set up a local LLM with computer vision capabilities using Google's Gemma 4B model, though integration is pending. The architecture is designed to support future integration with local models.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Video Analysis**  
  Processes live video feeds to interpret and describe visual content.

- **Natural Language Interaction**  
  Utilizes ChatGPT 4.0 Vision API for scene-based queries.

- **Modular Design**  
  Structured to support both cloud-based APIs and local inference (Gemma 4B ready).

## 🧰 Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend (Optional):** Python/FastAPI or Node.js  
- **AI/LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4 Vision, future-ready for Google's Gemma 4B  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 🔮 Future Plans

- **Integrate Gemma 4B**  
  Implement on-device inference to reduce latency and external API reliance.

- **Real-time Model Switching**  
  Develop functionality to toggle between remote and local models based on context and performance.

- **Enhanced Scene Understanding**  
  Incorporate advanced computer vision techniques for object tracking and action recognition.
